## About Me
Hi there! ðŸ‘‹ I'm Ashan. Welcome to my GitHub profile! I'm passionate about coding, learning, and building solutions that make a difference. Here's a bit more about me:

## Skills & Interests
- **Networking**: TCP/IP, Routing (OSPF, BGP), VLANs, Subnetting, Wireshark
- **Cybersecurity**: Penetration Testing, Vulnerability Assessment, Incident Response
- **Tools**: Metasploit, Wireshark, Kali Linux, Nessus, Burp Suite
- **Certifications**:  Cisco CCNA (In Progress)

## Featured Projects
1. **[Networking Projects](#)**: This repository contains three networking projects created using Cisco Packet Tracer. Each project focuses on specific networking concepts and configurations, designed to enhance understanding and practical skills in network design and management.
2. **[branch-office-network-pt](#)**: A compact Packet Tracer project featuring two branch offices connected to a head office. It includes VLANs, inter-VLAN routing, OSPF, trunk ports, DHCP, and secure remote management via SSH and SVI. Built for simplicity and scalability, itâ€™s perfect for understanding and practicing enterprise network setups.
3. **[Network-Traffic-Check](#)**: This Python project simulates network traffic by generating random public IP addresses and checks them against a set of predefined firewall rules. It demonstrates how to allow or block traffic based on specific IP addresses, providing a simple simulation of network security mechanisms. The script generates 100 random IP addresses, evaluates them against a list of allowed IPs, and prints whether the traffic is allowed or blocked. 
4. **[RPC-Game](#)**: This Python program allows the user to choose between rock, paper, and scissors. The computer randomly selects one of the options as well. The result is determined by the classic rules: rock beats scissors, scissors beats paper, and paper beats rock. The game checks if the user's input is valid and compares the choices to announce the winner or if itâ€™s a tie.
